Just how dumb do they think we are? The Royal Vegas Online Casino is allowing gamblers to design their own slot machine at their www.ilovemyslot.com website. Punters get to choose themes, images, backgrounds for a new "5 reel, 9 pay-line slot game" (whatever that means). If you're into that kind of thing, you'll probably appreciate that the game offers "wild, scatter and free spin features with 3x multipliers and the capability to generate spins within the spins". Presumably, having a familiar visual environment will makes gamblers feel better about pumping the kid's milk money into a virtual one-armed bandit. The only way to make money at slots The designs that Royal Vegas judges to be the best (probably the ones that takes the most cash) will share in a $1000 (£685) prize. Unsurprisingly, Royal Vegas encourages everyone to have a go "no matter what your experience level". Alternatively, you could just flush all your spare cash down the loo (watch out for the coins, they can get caught in the U-bend).

Tribe takes big gamble on new casino | The Detroit News July 7, 2009 at 11:32 am Gaming in Michigan Tribe takes big gamble on new casino Battle Creek's FireKeepers set to open despite poor economy Nathan Hurst Purchase Image The FireKeepers Casino in Battle Creek boasts 2,680 slot machines and 78 table games that include roulette, craps and blackjack. (Dale G. Young / The Detroit News) Battle Creek --A little more than a year ago, drivers passing Exit 104 on Interstate 94 gazed onto corn fields that had been there for generations. But recently, the electric glow of the mega-sign marking the location of the new FireKeepers Casino was deemed too bright for passing motorists, so it was dimmed. The Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi hopes the future of the state's newest gambling facility will be just as bright. Scheduled to open early next month, FireKeepers Casino is a $300 million gamble for a small tribe during a big recession that has brought larger, more experienced gaming operations to their knees. "We're just happy we're opening," said Laura Spurr, chairwoman of the 1,000-member tribe, which spent 10 years battling legal blockades to open FireKeepers. "We think we're at the right place at the right time with the right people." The casino is one of the most ambitious tribal casino projects embarked upon in Michigan. While other facilities such as Soaring Eagle near Mount Pleasant opened to great success, Detroit's three non-tribal casinos -- MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino and Greektown Casino-Hotel -- have struggled in the past year as consumers pull back on discretionary spending. In big gambling meccas, Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J., year-over-year gaming revenues have declined by double-digit percentages since last year. "It's a tough time for all casinos, and newcomers are no exception," said Bill Eadington, a gaming expert based at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. "But the good thing about the economy is that it will bounce back. It's just a question of how quickly." In the troubles of others, Spurr and her tribe see potential. For one, the casino created 1,500 full- and part-time jobs at a time when Battle Creek -- like much of the state -- is struggling with a high unemployment rate, up to 12.7 percent in May, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's just a touch less than the state average of 14.1 percent, which is heavily influenced by the scores of jobless in southeast Michigan. The jobs were filled by tribal members and other locals. FireKeepers also is expected to have a positive spinoff impact, especially with local hotels. The hulking building alongside I-94, the heavily traveled interstate connecting Detroit and Chicago, is designed with a distinctively upscale flair, eschewing the "pole barn" look of less-expensive tribal ventures common in the Upper Peninsula. The three Detroit casinos, plus Soaring Eagle in Mount Pleasant and the Four Winds casino of the Pokagon Band in New Buffalo, are all less than a two-hour drive from FireKeepers. At FireKeepers, millions were spent on touches like a light show that's integrated with the casino-wide progressive jackpot promotion, as well as hundreds of plasma screens. The tribe elected to stick with a theme of natural elements -- earth, wind, water and fire -- instead of following the modern Las Vegas trend of kitsch-free chic. "We spent a lot of time looking at fit and finish and what would make customers most happy," said Bruce McKee, the casino's general manager. The result, he said, is a casino that's brighter and much cheerier inside than a traditional gambling hall. The Potawatomi also decided to go big, much bigger, in fact, than most of the other tribal casino brethren. The gaming floor itself measures 107,000 square feet, a bit larger than MGM Grand Detroit's gambling space. The facility has five restaurants, including a buffet, as well as a sports bar and cabaret. There's a VIP area for high-rollers, a large and well-lit poker room and thousands of state-of-the-art slot machines, as well as 78 table games. One notable absence is an on-site hotel. Spurr said the tribe opted to hold off on offering accommodations for now, but isn't ruling it out for the future. "After waiting for so long to get started, we just needed to start building as soon as possible," Spurr said. "But we're only using about half of the land we have here. We've got more than enough room to expand when the time is right." nhurst@detnews.com "> nhurst@detnews.com (313) 222-2293 FireKeepers by the numbers The Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi is getting ready to open its FireKeepers Casino in Battle Creek early next month, though an exact date hasn't yet been set.

Roulette in betting shops? It's all political spin Roulette in betting shops? It's all political spin ADVERTORIAL: The Fairer Gambling Campaign warns against the dangers of addictive betting machines. By Derek Webb Published 24 April 2012   Tweet Widget Gambling machines known as B2s were introduced into UK betting shops in 2001, at which point they were referred to as Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs). At that time UK betting shops were unregulated, and bookmakers avoided restrictions on gambling machines by claiming that FOBTs were used to "bet" on events occurring on software located outside the shop. During the first decade of operation, the growth of FOBTs can best be described as explosive. From nothing ten years earlier, the amount won by FOBTs in the year 2010-11 rose to £1.3 billion, far surpassing the £0.8 billion won by UK casinos. This is indicative of the presence of addictive content. FOBTs have now become so lucrative that operators are opening multiple shops in single locations to saturate communities with these money-spinning machines. FOBTs proved a major focus for the Select Committee Inquiry into the effectiveness of the 2005 Gambling Act, with Richard Caborn, a previous Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) Minister, admitting: "something had to be done [about FOBTs] but the government was powerless [prior to 2005]." The UK Government had the power to ban FOBTs altogether (as the Irish authorities have) through the 2005 Gambling Act, but there were a few political hurdles preventing such action: 1. The Government wanted to sell the Tote betting shops, which were enjoying large profits from FOBTs 2. The Government was receiving high amounts of tax revenue from FOBT profits 3. The bookmaking lobby had, and still has, many influential friends in politics Local authorities are required to "aim to permit" licensing of betting premises, with one licensing condition being that the primary activity be over-the-counter betting. Certain bookmaker's accounts show only 20% of turnover in shops is now on betting, with 80% coming from FOBTs. This means that shops are in breach of their licenses, but The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) is "comfortable" with this situation. Breaking the Code In November 2003, the DCMS, Gaming Board of Great Britain, and Association of British Bookmakers (representing around 85% of bookmakers in Great Britain) agreed a Code of Conduct as a theoretical control over FOBTs. One stipulation of the new Code was that the only casino-type game allowed on FOBTs would be roulette. That rule was quickly broken, and blackjack and other games soon started appearing on FOBTs. Now the operators want to move the Code's goal posts again, this time by increasing the number of machines allowed per shop from 4 to 6. At that time the Code was agreed Tessa Jowell was in charge of the DCMS, and stated that FOBTs would be "on probation." The logical assumption is that because the UKGC oversees licensing, it also has the role of monitoring FOBT probation. The UKGC position is, however, that: "whether the machines are on probation or not is a matter of DCMS policy". During the drafting of the 2005 Gambling Act, FOBTs were reclassified as gaming (rather than betting) machines. This meant there was no need to maintain the illusion of "betting" on external events, and that result generating software could be located within the machine itself. 2005 Gambling Act Licensing Objective 1 - Prevention of Problem Gambling At a recent hearing of the aforementioned Inquiry, a question about problem gambling related to FOBTs prompted the responsible Sectary of State, John Penrose, to ask for "firm evidence [that FOBTs cause problem gambling], not anecdote or concern". The Fairer Gambling campaign believes Mr Penrose should consider the following points : 1. If FOBTs are on probation, and the UKGC is responsible for enforcing the objective to prevent problem gambling; why is government and UKGC not already engaged in obtaining the evidence it needs? Surely there needs to be a method of assessing whether the objectives of the Act are being met? 2. If government wants proof "beyond reasonable doubt" and is of the opinion that academic research will not deliver this; is government implying that no evidence level would be adequate? 3. The New Statesman has published a blog on the subject for a number of years, amassing thousands of posts. To take one recently publicised case, David Armstrong of Norwich admitted that his FOBT addiction had cost him £100,000 over the past 4 years. Due to the sheer volume of these cases, they are not mere anecdotes - they are real people with real problems. 4. The British Gambling Prevalence Survey (BGPS) 2010 showed a 50% increase in problem gambling since the previous survey in 2007. It identified 18 gambling activities, and highlighted 5 activities as having the highest prevalence of problem gambling. Of those 5 activities, the one at which participants engaged in the least number of other gambling activities was FOBTs, showing that FOBTs are the primary driver of UK problem gambling. 5. Further, the BGPS showed that compared to the other 17 activities, FOBTS have: a.) The joint highest ratio of use by 16 to 24 year old gamblers b.) The second highest ratio of use by unemployed gamblers c.) The highest ratio of use by the lowest income quintile gamblers d.) The third highest ratio of at-risk high-time and high-spend gamblers 6. Astoundingly, the average win per FOBT per hour used (not per hour accessible) is over £30. However the BPGS identified gamblers losing only £7 per hour as high-spend gamblers. Put simply, the BGPS, whilst correctly identifying the trends, is only revealing a fraction of the reality of problem gambling. 7. For casino roulette, the amount the players lose as a percentage of the amount of player funds used (the retention percentage) is 15%. For FOBTs, the UKGC does not obtain the retention percentage and the bookmakers don't make it public. Given that roulette is the main game (over 90% of play) on FOBTs, FOBT roulette is over 3 times faster than casino roulette, and FOBT players have generally lower funds than casino players, the FOBT retention percentage could be as high as 50% or even 75%. A high retention percentage on a high volume activity is clear evidence of addictive content. 8. The Fairer Gambling Campaign made a written submission to the DCMS hearing referencing this evidence, but was not permitted to give oral evidence. This was not surprising, as a previous advert of the campaign had attracted one objection - from the politicians of the All-Party Betting and Gaming Committee. 2005 Gambling Act Licensing Objective 2 - Prevention of Crime Associated with Gambling Operators are clustering betting shops in poorer areas simply to maximize FOBT profits. These premises are resourced with minimal staff on low wages, giving underage and non-sober gamblers easy access to the addictive content on FOBTs. There has been an escalation of crime in betting shops since the introduction of FOBTs. Robberies and assaults on staff are everyday occurrences and criminal damage on premises is often going unreported. 2005 Gambling Act Licensing Objective 3 - Fair and Open Gambling An FOBT can take up to £100 per spin (every 20 seconds) compared to a £2 maximum on a slot machine in more highly taxed and heavily regulated casinos. FOBT players are not informed that the roulette result is determined before the virtual ball starts spinning or of the FOBT retention percentage. There is zero consideration of consumer protection. Final thoughts Politicians seemingly apathetic attitude is motivated by a desire to protect the bookmakers and the tax revenue generated on the back of legally questionable FOBT profits from problem gamblers in poor communities. This is not the Big Society, and it's not joined-up government. FOBTs are being operated in breach of all three licensing objectives. If the Government is not willing to solve the FOBT issue that it has itself created, how can it be trusted to solve anything?

Published 1st January 2014 HIGH STAKES: Poker players put their hands in [GETTY] “After playing for ages (hours or even days) they can't face the thought of heading home with nothing” With your eyes fixed on scoring a big prize you've been focusing on winning seats in large tournaments via online satellites. And here you are, on plan, sitting in the latter stages of a big guarantee No-Limit Hold'em tourney with the bubble fast approaching (for newbies: the "bubble" is that time in a tournament when you are getting real close to the money - the cash payouts). Lots of players tighten up at this stage. After playing for ages (hours or even days) they can't face the thought of heading home with nothing. But you're not here to scrape through for a small cash, your goal this year is to be a big winner. To win the tournament you need chips so you've got to take adVantage of your opponents' fears and pressurise them while they are feeling scared and vulnerable. Two more players need to be eliminated before you hit the cash and play at your table has tightened up so much that for the last 20 to 25 minutes barely a hand has gone to the flop. You land Ace-Nine of Clubs in a middle position and have just fourteen big blinds left. The blinds are now 2,000-4,000 with an ante and there are one or two bigger stacks left to act after you. Play folds to you and it's decision time. It's not a great hand to play from the middle seats but it's an Ace, it's suited, and the players are in survival mode. It's time to waVe the needle in the face of these potential bubble boys. Try a raise of around 12,000 to steal the pot. What if you get called? Then you face an even harder decision on the flop. But "he who dares wins, Rodders" so consider going postal on the flop by moving all-in!
